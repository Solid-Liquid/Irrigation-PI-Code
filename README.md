Team Members: Ian Hinze, Marvin Mallari, Christian Martinez, Daniel Stein, Froilan Campos, Varun Ganesh

Award-winning team project with the goal of creating a low-energy, low-cost irrigation system controller
with Raspberry PI and STM boards. The award was for best computer science presentation at the
CSUN Senior Design Project Showcase (2019)

This repository is a code dump for the Raspberry PI side code of the project. This code was never on Github, and was
programmed directly on a Raspberry PI system.
